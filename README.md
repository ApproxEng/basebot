BaseBot
=======

Basebot is a set of laser cut templates, hardware recommendations and guides and software for a cheap wheeled robotics platform.

Get the SVG or DXF files for the acrylic parts from this repository, and see the wiki for [the bill of materials](http://basebot.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_of_Materials) and [assembly instructions](http://basebot.org/w/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions) - these don't currently include control or power circuitry, but you'll end up with a solid chassis including motors ready for your controller of choice...

The latest version (v16) looks like this (lacking any form of control circuitry!)

This has evolved quite a bit from an earlier version (v4 or so)

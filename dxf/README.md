These are DXF files generated from the SVG files in the /svg directory. They should not be regarded as the original source, so don't edit them and expect edits to be persisted!

The opaque.dxf and transparent.dxf files are for the opaque and transparent parts respectively of the version of the BaseBot which came to EMF2014 - if you want a duplicate of that model you need to cut those parts, and then obtain the rest of the bits and assemble them. Details of this process can be found on the basebot wiki, see the home page link for more information.
